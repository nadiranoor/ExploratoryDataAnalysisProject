As we face a global crisis together, many of us are slowly but surely forgetting the connections we had with the emotion of happiness. We have been faced with stress, grief, anxiety, and worry for nearly an entire year now. In honor of the International Day of Happiness (March 20th) approaching us quickly, I thought now would be a better time than ever to look into what brings us true happiness worldwide.
I decided to do this by analyzing the 2019 World Happiness Report published by Gallup World Poll. This dataset ranks 156 countries based on what is known as the Cantril Ladder - a measure that takes into account how respondents rank the current state of their own lives in their respective home countries. It also looks into 6 measures (GDP per Capita, Social Support, Life Expectancy, Freedom to Make Life Choices, Generosity, and Trust in Government) and how respondents weigh these measures into their well-being and general happiness scores. I hope that we could look at this pre-pandemic information to help us in rediscovering the emotion of happiness as a global unit post-pandemic. For those interested, I have posted a Medium article going inyo more depth about the topic here: https://nadiranoor.medium.com/what-i-learned-from-the-world-happiness-report-7e427ad6693d
